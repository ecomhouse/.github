## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** report it via public GitHub issues. Instead, please help us keep the community safe by reporting it privately.

Please report security vulnerabilities by sending an email to:
**[contact@ecom.house](mailto:contact@ecom.house)**

### What to include in your report:
* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept scripts or screenshots are highly appreciated).
* Potential impact of the vulnerability.

### What we will do:
1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. We will send a follow-up after investigating the issue to confirm its status.
3. We will work on a fix and notify you once it is ready to be released.
4. We will give credit to the reporter in our security advisories, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep our software and community safe!
